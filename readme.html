<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>This is a part of Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. This is the third project I have made and the second project I have made writing python. Due to my stubborness to learn how to handle image uploads w ith Google App Engine this project took a while longer than I had planned. About 20 hours all in all.</p>

<p>I also learned a lot about how to work with the database ndb on Google App Engine.</p>

<p>Furthermore I implemented ajax functionality for the liking posts.</p>
