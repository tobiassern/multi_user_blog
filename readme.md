## Motivation

This is a part of Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. This is the third project I have made and the second project I have made writing python. Due to my stubborness to learn how to handle image uploads w ith Google App Engine this project took a while longer than I had planned. About 20 hours all in all.

I also learned a lot about how to work with the database ndb on Google App Engine.

Furthermore I implemented ajax functionality for the liking posts.

## Installation

In order to run this project you have to setup a Google App Engine Project and change the application id in the app.yaml file to the corresponding value.
